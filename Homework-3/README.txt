This zip folder contains [SRC_Report.pdf, Statistics.txt file and SRC.py]

SRC.py is the .py version of my Colab Notebook

Link to the Colab Notebook: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qgydo7nOOc6-JqDMkA8LXAC34GYima-S/view?usp=sharing

I've included the link in the last page of the Report as well.

Assumptions :-
	- Your personal google drive has the SemEval2010_task8_all_data folder in it, ***please upload your folder directly to your drive, and do not keep it inside any sub folder*** 
	  (This is because the path in colab is "/content/drive/MyDrive/SemEval2010_task8_all_data/SemEval2010_task8_training/TRAIN_FILE.TXT" or 
							    "/content/drive/MyDrive/SemEval2010_task8_all_data/SemEval2010_task8_testing_keys/TEST_FILE_FULL.TXT") 
	- So please upload "SemEval2010_task8_all_data" to the default/home directory in your google drive

To Run: 
	- Open the link to the notebook
	- Click "Runtime" in the task bar and "Run All"
	- You will get a prompt to provide the colab runtime with permission to your drive, provide the permission and proceed, these steps are self explanatory
